# About me
Hi, my name is Drisya Antose, and I am a first year Public Policy Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I am passionate about data driven decision policymaking, specifically in energy and infrastructure that relates to energy. I have research experience in policy however with my masterâ€™s degree, I am hoping to leverage new tools to leverage policy making and analysis. Currently, I am looking for opportunities that would allow me to use creative data tools within critical policy issues in energy and critical infrastructure. 



# What I hope to learn

1. Creating translatable graphs for a wider audience, learning nuances in color and other tools. 
2. Gaining data visualization skills that would aid me to succinctly communicate my research.
3. Developing graph critiquing skills, and ability to give feedback on various visuals.

# What I hope to do after I graduate

I hope to work at the intersection of creative tools and critical policy issues, especially using tools to inform a wider audience.
