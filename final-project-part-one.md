# Outline

Climate finance is an impactful financial tool that allocates resources for climate change activities, and funds are allocated and dispensed to communities affected by climate change. While climate finance is critical, it is nascent in terms of development and adaptation, therefore there are educational gaps within communities who are impacted by climate change. 
This story is a story that is designed to raise awareness about climate finance, particularly individuals in the region who are affected by these policies. Further, this would contextualize Africa’s climate finance initiatives within a global framework, while analyzing real world impact. Data will be used to draw trends between regions, highlighting specific country case studies, and tying it in with country demographics relevant to this analysis. 


1.	Setting Up Context: “What is climate finance?”
Introduction to climate finance and highlighting the importance of this tool. Giving examples of climate finance, trends, and history of this tool. 
2.	The Regional Lens:  “Why is this important for Sub-Saharan Africa?”
How is climate finance is allocated within the region? What are the gaps in funding requirements vs realized funding? 
3.	Case study:  “What high-level comparisons can be drawn?”
Two regions on contrasting ends of the climate finance spectrum can be integrated to show parallel side by side case study of climate finance in this domain. 
4.	Impact : “Why does this matter to people?”
This section will outline why this issue impacts the citizens of these countries and their livelihoods. 
5.	Call to action: “Empower citizens to understand and advocate for effective climate finance tools in their communities”

# The data
My data is taken from the Climate Policy Initiative. The methodology used by the data collectors was using extensive data scoping exercises and datasets about project financing in the region. The data set is divided into financing for mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation includes emission reduction, while adaptation deals with climate resilience. The financial flows are also separated into domestic and international financial activities while classifying the actors involved in these financing initiatives. 

Further, the data is classified according to regions in the continent, while also using standard UN labelling to classify the countries according to income and development status. However, data scientists recognize the gaps in the data presented as well. Specifically in domestic financing, private sector data, and Chinese investment. This is due to the lack in transparency and the lack of climate-relevance data. 

The data will be used to show needs and financing patterns across the subcontinent. Financing sources will be charted through sectioned graphs to show changes in funding sources, further pie charts will be used to show the financing objectives (adaptation, mitigation, dual benefits). Lastly, a general demographic graph will be included to show the features of the country.

# Method and medium
I will be using tableau to create the various interactive visualizations. These visualizations will be embedded in Shorthand where I will create a cohesive story with the use of interactive slides.
