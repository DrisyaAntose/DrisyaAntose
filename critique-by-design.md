## The future of wind energy is now looking GUST right 


## Step one: the visualization

Over the last couple of months, I have taken an interest in energy policy. With climate change policy in focus, it is not surprise that now more than ever we need data that is easy and accessible to the masses on indicators such as renewable energy markers, carbon readings, and warming trends. Therefore, this Makeover Monday assignment was an opportunity for me to visualize data I believe is critical. Therefore, I chose this website and visual for the makeover.

## Step two: the critique

It is evident that while the diagrammatic representations of the windmill in the data serves as a tool to capture the attention of the reader. It clearly takes away from understanding the different data sets and trends clearly. On closer observation, we see that the designer who created the observation had attempted to integrate three different data sets into the same visual. This overloaded the x axis, created confusion in the labels, and made it difficult to make out certain data points. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution

After having a closer look at the data set and the visual, I decided to separate the data into two separate visuals. With a vague idea in mind, I decided to pick up my iPad and digitally sketch a rough draft.

## Step four: Test the solution

After sketching out the rough visuals, I decided to present it to 3 of my classmates to get their feedback. You’ll find below my interview script: 

Questions to ask 
1.	What do you think this is showing?
2.	What stands out to you first?
3.	Is there anything that seems confusing or unclear?
4.	Is there anything you’d tweak or do differently?



Results: 

I had three interviewees, and they were three students from Heinz, who were enrolled in the class. 

Interviewee #1: Heinz Student, MISM 25

Interviewee #2: Heinz Student, MSPPM 26 

Interviewee #3: Heinz Student, MEIM 25


What do you think this is showing: 

1: A downward trending bar chart, and a sectioned map showing wind energy trends. 

2: Two visuals, both showing two sets of data, one of installed capacity in wind energy and the other is capturing total investment in wind energy. 

3: Two visuals with individual legends, one is showing homes powered and wind capacity, another is showing investment 

What stands out to you first?

1: The colors and the map, it is evident that Texas is huge in wind power. 

2: Texas is a huge stakeholder in wind energy.

3: There’s a lot of money in Texas for wind energy. 

Is there anything that seems confusing or unclear?

1: There is some ambiguity around what exactly I am looking at, data wise, in the bar chart. What do the legends mean?

2: The colors and shading in the legend for both graphs seem difficult to understand. 

3: Not sure how these two data sets relate to each other. 

Is there anything you’d tweak or do differently?

1: I would maybe separate the bar chart into two split charts so the distinctions and trends in data are seen clearly. 

2: The title is something I would change, there is lack of clarity on what we are supposed to take away from the data. 

3: I would want more clarity on the data, and more of a catchy title

Synthesis: 

The topline feedback I learn was that there was confusion across the board about the use of data sets and if they are being used appropriately and strategically. While they did agree that my new renderings were far clearer and better done than the original, they believed that the visual could benefit from further splicing. The feedback regarding the titles also gave me an opportunity to think about how I would want to reapproach the data, and what I believe the main takeaway from the data should be. 

## Step five: build the solution

With all this feedback in mind, and with clarity on how to move ahead, I went on to build the solution on tableau. I extracted the data and built an excel sheet from the original source, relabeled them on tableau and began my visualization promptly.
