# Wireframes / storyboards

This is the current shorthand I am using to document my story.

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience was initially the youth of Africa to educate them on the state of climate finance. However, being cognizant that I lack the local perspective, I have reverted to my domain strength of energy policy and have decided to create a informative fundraising narrative to potential donors. 

## Interview and learnings 
The goals from my interviews is to guage how my story can be told to a wider audience. More than a script, our team employed a panel discussion style to provide and recieve feedback. 

I did interviews with two of my classmates to understand if they feel like I have a story that can be told. While they were intrigued by the overarching topic of climate finance, they struggled to link a story. I got a recommendation to reduce my narrative to a personal level, where I try to capture the gravity of climate finance while building a personal narrative. 

Therefore, I introduced Imani, a farmer who is impacted by the shifts in climate change. She helps anchor the story through how her life is impacted by changes in rainfall, the inability for an NGO to sustain, and the predictive data on how much regions and the continent needs and how much does current climate finance funding provide. 

Another feedback I got is integrating metrics that help understand top 5 and bottom 5 in terms of countries that need and use climate finance. While also integrating case studies from each country.  

There was also ambiguity on what my audience could be, and considering the nature of climate finance, I got the recommendation to build my story for fundraising. Further, while driving home the impact their donation could have on farmers such as Imani. 


# Identified changes for Part III

The changes that have been implemented are the introduction of Imani, and the story unfolding with Imani’s experiences. This has also shifted macro-level statistics, to more engaging story telling by connecting a personal narrative to the trends we have displayed. There will also be changes in country-level insight provided by the graphs. The content and narrative will also change as the audience has been changed. We will also use predictive date to be tied back into Imani’s case study.
