# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
My project has seen considerable evolution since Part I and Part II. First, there was a narrative shift where I tried to shift my focus away from displaying trends and trying to tell facts but into building a compelling story for the readers and audience. This was advice I incorporated after my second round of peer reviews, where I was given feedback that I needed a consistent thread throughout the data I am sharing. This helped shape the character of Imani. 
While Imani considerably shifted the tangent of the story I was weaving, a pivotal moment for me was trying to identify the audience for my project. It first began with the youth of Africa being the focus and soon the focus shifted to crafting this around a fundraising campaign. Further, this pushed me to identify more gaps between the funding and needs for the African Subcontinent.
 This also saw a shift in how I thought about the visuals. Now, I was prompted to visualize and illustrate along the lines of a fundraise campaign. This prompted me to include more information on trends, and gaps in financing than carrying out overall informational case studies. The text used in the slides also changed soon to convey a tone of urgency, the language was refined to communicate the urgent need for funding. 


## The audience
Narrowing down the audience was a critical piece in my story telling with data journey. While I had a passion for climate finance, I struggled to craft a compelling story. However, through peer reviewing, I was advised on the effectiveness of the data if it was applied to potential donors.  This also altered the messaging for my presentation. It pivoted it from an informative piece to a story built to urge donors to contribute to this cause. With the help of visualizations and storytelling, I tried to make a pitch for climate finance as an investment and a cause for justice.


## Final design decisions

1.	I aimed for visual simplicity since I planned to make this a pitch more than an informational story. Therefore, extensive bar-based visuals were used to demonstrate gaps. 
2.	The color choices were also strategically used to indicate scarcity and availability of resources. 
3.	Transitional pictures were utilized to capture the attention of the audience. 
4.	The frames and the flow used in the shorthand mimicked a pitch. It consisted of context, story, and a call to action to the donor. 



# Final thoughts
This project was a journey since I have seen it evolve from an interest to a story. The characterization along with the display of data has been challenging but rewarding. Looking ahead, I wish I had the time to integrate more interactive elements and build a full-fledged story for Imani. However, due to limitations with my health, it has been difficult to work towards building a higher quality narrative. 
Further, I have also learnt the value in being able to take numbers and craft a call to action. I felt challenged to think of what is the most compelling for a donor, while doing justice to the cause. My learnings from this class and project have urged me to think of data as a tool for advocacy, not just numbers.
